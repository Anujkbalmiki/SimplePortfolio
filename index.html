      <h2>Would Like to Know about me!</h2>
      <p>I am a beginner-level full stack web developer, currently building up my skills by creating projects and landing pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I explore the world of web development, I'm practicing the basics of these core technologies to understand how they work together to create interactive and visually appealing websites. I'm also starting to learn frameworks like Node.js for backend development, where I'm getting familiar with setting up simple servers and handling data. With AngularJS, I'm exploring how to build basic applications that can manage and display data effectively. I'm also diving into ReactJS, experimenting with creating responsive user interfaces. These experiences are helping me grasp the fundamentals of full stack development, and I'm excited to keep learning and improving as I take on new projects.
